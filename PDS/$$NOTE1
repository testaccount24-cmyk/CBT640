Hi Sam,

Here is a contribution that may be useful for users of Levi, Ray
& Shoup's VPS printing software.

It is a template-based separator page exit that allows VPS users
to:

 - print spectacular full-color separator pages,
 - initialise printers,
 - display information on a printer's LCD about the currently
   printing job etc.

Cheers,
Andrew Armstrong

BTW, I've changed by email address from andrew_armstrong@bigpond.com
to a.armstrong@optusnet.com.au (in case you are maintaining a
database of contributers).
